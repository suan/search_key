Oops!

So I almost completed this project until I discovered there's already something out there that works great and has even more features. Turns out I didn't look deeply enough when doing my intial research.

I hate redundant work with a passion, so I'm going to upload what I have and leave it at that, while I move on to other endeavors since my itch has already been scratched. Feel free to use anything that's here.

In the meantime, I whole-heartedly recommend [SlashSearch][slashsearch]. It's also open source and [on Github][github]!
